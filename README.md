# LED Party And Xmass Light Controller

ATMGEA328P based WS2801 LED controller with analog audio input, microSD card reader, 16x2 I2C LCD, 2 (3) x LED Channels, Buck regulator, RTC (for automatic power on and off), relay output (for non-mains use) and more!

More info and pictures comming soon!

Only Xmas mode is fully working, and party mode is only partially. In the future, I will make more for ambient lighting.
